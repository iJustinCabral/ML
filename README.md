# My Machine Learning Testing Ground

This repository is a place where I'll be uploading all the different tests and tutorials I follow regarding machine learning. I've become fascinated with LLMs and
neural networks over the past year and have finally decided to dive in and learn everything about them. While I may create seperate repositories that encompass a
certain project, this will be where my tests and tutorials will live.
